# Arctic Monkeys README
## Why this website was made
I made this website because I wanted to explain about the Indie-Rock band Arctic Monkeys and why I liked the band so much in general.
I wanted to explian more about Arctic Monkeys and give my own  recommendations to others. I like the band Arctic Monkeys and I think others should at least learn them a little.
## Things I learned when making this website
- I learned how to do more CSS
- More about some of Arctic Monkey's older songs
- Learned a small amount of JS
- Learned how to make more pages for a website
- Got to understand more about coding
- I learned how to expand my website into differnet sections
## Somethng I wish I learned or knew
I wish I learned more about CSS in depth or harder pieces of coding. I also wish I new more about JS since I don't know much about JS
I think it would have also been useful if I knew other short cuts to type coding quicker.
## My next Project
I think my next project would be over a solo singer. The singer would be the J-Pop/J-Rock singer Ado whos sung various of songs by herself or with another person
In order to make the website I would probably just do what I did with this website but make the website more public and User interactive where the person on the website would be able to do more things.
There would also be more images and other things that Ado fans would understand or know at least.
### About me
My name is Isaac and I am just a type of person who overall just enjoys music and mostly likes spending time by myself. Overall I think music of my taste is easiest to understand and/or write about since I can easily express myself in such kinds of ways.
