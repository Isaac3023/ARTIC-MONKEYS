          <h1>Why I Like Arctic Monkeys</h1>
    <p>
        I like Arctic Monkeys because I love the way that the music sounds in their songs/albums sound
the way that Arctic Monkeys sounds to me is an amazing thing because</p>
    <p> I generally just enjoy music like the types of music they make.</p>
<h4>Arctic Monkeys is one of the many artist that I, myself love and I think other people should at least give them a try</h4>
        <p>A good starter song from them in my opinion would be the song <b>"505"</b> since it has a good calm tone and mood and it can resonate with a lot of people in differnet ways</p>
